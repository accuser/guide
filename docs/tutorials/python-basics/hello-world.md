Welcome to your first step in learning Python! In this tutorial, we'll guide you through creating a simple program that displays the message "Hello, World!" on your screen. This is a common starting point for learning any programming language.


## What you'll learn

- How to open Python's interactive shell
- How to write a basic Python command
- How to run your first Python program

## Requirements

- A computer with Python installed (version 3.6 or later)

## Open Python's interactive shell

1. On Windows:
   - Click the Start menu
   - Type "Python" in the search bar
   - Click on "Python (Python 3.x)"

   On Mac or Linux:
   - Open the Terminal application
   - Type `python3` and press Enter

2. You should see something like this:
   ```
   Python 3.x.x (default, Month Day Year, HH:MM:SS)
   [GCC x.x.x] on linux
   Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
   >>>
   ```
   The `>>>` is called the Python prompt. It's where you'll type your Python commands.

## Write your first Python command

At the Python prompt (`>>>`), type the following command:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Press :kbd[Enter] or :kbd[&hookleftarrow;] to run the command.

You should see the output:

```
Hello, World!
```

Well done! You've just run your first Python program!

## Understand what happened

Let's break down what we did:

- `print()` is a Python function that displays text on the screen.
- The text inside the parentheses `()` is what gets displayed.
- We put our text, `"Hello, World!"`, inside quotation marks to show it's a string (a sequence of characters).

## Try more print commands

Now that you've got the hang of it, try these:

1. Print your name:
   ```python
   print("Hello, <your name>!")
   ```

2. Print multiple lines:
   ```python
   print("Line 1")
   print("Line 2")
   print("Line 3")
   ```

3. Print a calculation:
   ```python
   print(2 + 2)
   ```

## Next steps

- Try changing the text inside the `print()` function to display different messages.
- Experiment with printing numbers and simple calculations.
- In your next lesson, you'll learn about variables and how to store information in your programs.

Practice makes perfect. Don't worry if you make mistakes - they're a normal part of learning to code!
